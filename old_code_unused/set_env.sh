Need to stop going to restroom so often
Additionally using restroom opens window for phone temptation, SHOULD MAKE IT A RULE 
TO NEVER LEAVE PHONE IN RESTROOM

Go to restroom -> Phone in restroom -> Instagram -> 30 minutes wasted (or 40)

WAKE UP EARLY AND TAKE CONTROL
START WITH THE MOMENTUM IN YOUR FAVOR!!!!
COMPOUNDS OVER TIME!!!
